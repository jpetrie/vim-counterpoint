INTRODUCTION                        *counterpoint*

Counterpoint provides a set of commands to navigate between file counterparts.
Counterpoint takes a fairly broad view of what constitutes a counterpart;
traditionally "a.h" and "a.cpp" would be considered counterparts of eachother,
and indeed Counterpoint supports that. However, Counterpoint would also treat
"a.osx.cpp" and "a.win.cpp" as members of the same collection of counterparts.

More specifically, Counterpoint navigates between a group of files defined by
a root name that is determined by taking the substring of the name up until 
the first dot.

A special exemption is made for files that begin with a dot; for these files,
the root file name is determined by taking the substring to the second dot.

COMMANDS                            *counterpoint-commands* 

Counterpoint provides the following globally-available commands.

                                    *counterpoint-:CounterpointNext*
:CounterpointNext              Edit the next counterpart, alphabetically.

                                    *counterpoint-:CounterpointPrevious*
:CounterpointPrevious          Edit the previous counterpart, alphabetically. 

                                    *counterpoint-:CounterpointAddSearchPath*
:CounterpointAddSearchPath <path>
                                    Adds a path to the counterpart search path set.
                                    Paths are relative to the current file at the
                                    time Counterpoint's cycling is invoked.

                                    *counterpoint-:CounterpointRemoveSearchPath*
:CounterpointRemoveSearchPath <path>
                                    Removes a path from the counterpart search set.
                                    Removing a path must be done via the exact same
                                    string that the path was added with; symbolic
                                    links, et cetera, are not interpreted.
